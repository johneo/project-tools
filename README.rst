=============
project-tools
=============

Project tools is a base set of tools a developer might use to start a new project:

* define environments
* define packages for install into environments
* deploy local and aws ec2 environments
* configure deployed environments
* build and configure services on deployed environments
* deploy code to deployed environments

The initial (and current) version of project-tools is written towards deploying a Django gis environment; future updates will include abstracting the gis specific portions out of the code, making it one of the options for install.

Read the fabfile, vagrantfile and configs if you would like to know more about what project-tools does. I'll add docs as I start to abstract out gis.

Feedback welcomed!
